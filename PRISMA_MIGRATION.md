# Prisma Migration Guide

## Summary of Changes

Your Gemini CLI Manager has been successfully migrated from `@vercel/postgres` to **Prisma ORM**. This provides better type safety, migrations, and development experience.

## What Changed

### 1. Database Layer (`src/lib/db.ts`)
- âœ… Replaced direct SQL queries with Prisma ORM calls
- âœ… Improved TypeScript type safety
- âœ… Better error handling and consistency
- âœ… Automatic migrations instead of manual table creation

### 2. Environment Variables
The following variables are now **required** in your Vercel environment:
- `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` (main database connection)
- `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` (direct connection for migrations)

### 3. New Files Added
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema definition
- `src/lib/prisma.ts` - Prisma client configuration

### 4. Dependencies Added
- `prisma` - Prisma CLI and development tools
- `@prisma/client` - Prisma client for runtime

## Deployment to Vercel

### Step 1: Environment Variables
In your Vercel dashboard, make sure you have these environment variables set:

```env
# Required for Prisma
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL=your_vercel_postgres_prisma_url
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING=your_vercel_postgres_non_pooling_url

# Application
APP_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secure_random_string
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
CRON_SECRET=your_cron_secret
```

### Step 2: Database Migration
When you deploy to Vercel, Prisma will automatically:
1. Generate the Prisma client
2. Create the database tables if they don't exist
3. Apply any pending migrations

### Step 3: Build Script
No changes needed - the build process will automatically:
1. Generate Prisma client
2. Build the Next.js application
3. Deploy successfully

## Benefits of Prisma

### âœ… Type Safety
- Automatic TypeScript types for all database operations
- Compile-time checks for database queries
- IntelliSense support in your IDE

### âœ… Better Developer Experience
- Schema-first approach with `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Built-in migration system
- Database introspection and generation

### âœ… Performance
- Connection pooling
- Query optimization
- Prepared statements

### âœ… Maintainability
- Centralized schema definition
- Version-controlled migrations
- Easier refactoring

## Local Development

To work with the database locally:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client after schema changes
npx prisma generate

# Push schema changes to database
npx prisma db push

# Open Prisma Studio (database browser)
npx prisma studio
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Errors
If you get Prisma-related build errors:
1. Make sure `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` and `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` are set
2. Run `npx prisma generate` locally
3. Commit and push the generated client

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify your Vercel Postgres environment variables
- Check that the connection strings are correct
- Ensure your database is accessible from Vercel

## Migration Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your application now uses Prisma ORM for all database operations. The functionality remains exactly the same, but with improved type safety and developer experience.

All existing data will be preserved during the migration - Prisma uses the same table structure as before.
